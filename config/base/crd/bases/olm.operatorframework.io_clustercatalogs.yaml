                  A ClusterCatalog's priority is used by clients as a tie-breaker between ClusterCatalogs that meet the client's requirements.
                  For example, in the case where multiple ClusterCatalogs provide the same bundle.
                  A higher number means higher priority. Negative number as also accepted.

                  conditions is a representation of the current state for this ClusterCatalog.
                  The status is represented by a set of "conditions".

                  Each condition is generally structured in the following format:
                    - Type: a string representation of the condition type. More or less the condition "name".
                    - Status: a string representation of the state of the condition. Can be one of ["True", "False", "Unknown"].
                    - Reason: a string representation of the reason for the current state of the condition. Typically useful for building automation around particular Type+Reason combinations.
                    - Message: a human-readable message that further elaborates on the state of the condition.

                  The current set of condition types are:
                    - "Unpacked", epresents whether, or not, the catalog contents have been successfully unpacked.
                    - "Deleted", represents whether, or not, the catalog contents have been successfully deleted.

                  The current set of reasons are:
                    - "UnpackPending", this reason is set on the "Unpack" condition when unpacking the catalog has not started.
                    - "Unpacking", this reason is set on the "Unpack" condition when the catalog is being unpacked.
                    - "UnpackSuccessful", this reason is set on the "Unpack" condition when unpacking the catalog is successful and the catalog metadata is available to the cluster.
                    - "FailedToStore", this reason is set on the "Unpack" condition when an error has been encountered while storing the contents of the catalog.
                    - "FailedToDelete", this reason is set on the "Delete" condition when an error has been encountered while deleting the contents of the catalog.
